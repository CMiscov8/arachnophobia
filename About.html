<H2 CLASS="western">What the SpIDer app does</H2>
<P>The SpIDer app allows you to identify spiders using the camera
feature. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>If you have a low tolerance for spiders, the camera will not
	display, it will simply tell you when the image is matchable.</P>
	<LI><P>If you have a medium tolerance for spiders, the camera will
	show a cartoon spider within the viewfinder</P>
	<LI><P>If you have a high tolerance for spiders - perhaps you are an
	arachnophile using the app for indentification &ndash; the camera
	will act normally, showing the spider within the viewfinder</P>
</UL>
<H2 CLASS="western">The Psychology behind the SpIDer App</H2>
<P>I used to be terrified of spiders. I couldn't look at pictures of
spiders, and definitely couldn't touch spiders, even if they were
squished. However, I found the by identifying and naming the spiders
I came across, I reduced the fear I felt considerably. Taming by
Naming. As well, by categorizing spiders as safe, mildly harmful, or
deadly, we allow for a more rational approach to their appearance in
our lives.</P>
<P>I still don't like spiders, but I no longer feel the need to throw
my phone across the room whenever a picture of one comes through my
feed. I even touched a little plastic one with by bare hands!!! Now
that's what I call progress.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Disclaimer</H2>
<P>Although I have tried my best to make the app as accurate as
possible with the technology available, identification by visual
matching is as yet an imperfect science. Please use caution around
unknown species of spiders, and double check identification with a
secondary source before approaching them.</P>
<P>I AM IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR DEATH OR DISMEMBERMENT BY SPIDER.</P>
